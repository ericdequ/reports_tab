The DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) lays out the technical
requirements that federal agencies must conform to when submitting
data to USAspending.gov. DAIMS reflects all relevant requirements and
deadlines in OMB memos and is consistent with the policies they lay
out. Federal agencies should generally not need to reference these
memos to understand their FFATA/DATA Act submission responsibilities
or DAIMS requirements.
