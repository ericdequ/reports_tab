Financing accounts are non-budgetary accounts associated with each
credit program that hold balances, receive payments, and include
cash flows resulting from direct loan obligations or loan guarantee
commitments made on or after Fiscal Year 1992. They are reported to
Treasury via the Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted
Trial Balance System (GTAS), but  they do not represent spending in 
the budgetary sense because they fund loans that will be paid back. 
Thus, they should not be reported to the DATA Act Broker and are not 
published by USAspending.gov.  (Loans that will not be paid back in 
whole or part, including ones that are forgiven, are tracked as 
“subsidy costs” whose obligations are tracked on USAspending.gov.)
