The Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance
System (GTAS) is where federal entities, including agencies, provide
proprietary financial reporting information and information about
budget execution. Data in GTAS are used to generate the SF 133 report
containing budget execution for certain Treasury Accounts within the
federal government, as required by the

Some agencies submit financial data directly to GTAS but not to
USAspending.gov. USAspending.gov extracts data from GTAS on a daily
basis; the data are published along with File A, B, and C data each
month as context for governmentwide spending figures and for other
purposes. File A crosswalks with the SF 133 report, but the SF 133
report contains additional line items not featured in File A. GTAS
data are not directly downloadable from USAspending.gov, but are
instead available on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://portal.max.gov/portal/document/SF133/Budget/FACTS%20II%20-%20SF%20133%20Report%20on%20Budget%20Execution%20and%20Budgetary%20Resources.html">this government website</a>.
