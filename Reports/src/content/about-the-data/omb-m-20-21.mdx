This Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum implements
several CARES Act transparency reporting requirements, in so doing
requiring that agencies report Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC) in
their USAspending data to track pandemic relief spending from
supplemental appropriations. It also sets out a requirement for
award-level outlays in File C, for monthly financial data reporting to
USAspending.gov, and for program activity to be included in File
C. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Implementation-Guidance-for-Supplemental-Funding-Provided-in-Response.pdf">Visit this page to read the memorandum</a>.
