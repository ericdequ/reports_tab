While USAspending.gov is operated by the Treasury Department, it
receives data from a variety of government source systems outside of
Treasury, such as the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) and the
FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). USAspending.gov does not
validate the data as they are collected on external source systems,
although the DATA Act Broker system does provide some warnings and
errors based on data submitted directly by federal agencies (i.e.,
Files A, B, and C, as well as the Financial Assistance Broker
Submission (FABS)), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does
require agency senior accountable officials (SAO) to certify agency
submissions on a quarterly basis. Instead, USAspending.gov relies on
the data validation and internal controls of these external source
systems. Therefore, the imported data may not always align with the
data standards, definitions, and requirements established in OMB and
Treasury guidance.

More information about Broker validation rules and SAO certification can
be found in the "DAIMS Validation Rules" and "DAIMS Practices and
Procedures" links on the
