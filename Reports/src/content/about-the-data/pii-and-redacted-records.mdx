Redacted records allow for the removal of personally identifiable
 information (PII) from financial assistance award data while 
 preserving the individual award and most of its data elements (as opposed to aggregate 
 records, which group multiple awards together to avoid publishing PII).

A recipient name of "REDACTED DUE TO PII" indicates that the
associated financial assistance award was issued to an individual
whose name and other PII were redacted. Along with replacing the
individual's name with "REDACTED DUE TO PII," these records omit
location information that would otherwise be present (e.g., street
address and the last 4 digits of the ZIP code).

For more information about reporting requirements for financial assistance
awards containing PII, please refer to
