The award description data element is defined in the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/resources.html">Information Definition Document (IDD</a>) as follows:

-   For procurement awards: As per the Federal Procurement Data
    System (FPDS) data dictionary, the award description is a brief,
    summary-level, plain English description of the contract, award,
    or modification. The description field may also include abbreviations, 
    acronyms, or other information that are not plain English, such as 
    those identified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies.

-   For financial assistance awards: The award description is a
    plain-language description of the federal award purpose,
    activities to be performed, deliverables and expected outcomes,
    intended beneficiary(ies), and subrecipient activities if
    known/specified at the time of award.

Maintaining data quality for the award description field has been
persistently challenging for federal agencies. For example, some
submitted award descriptions are overly lengthy or technical, involve
administrative codes rather than words, or lack meaningful information
altogether. More information about award description data quality can
be found in the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report
