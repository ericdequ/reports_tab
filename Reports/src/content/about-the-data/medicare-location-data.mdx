The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports financial assistance
awards from Medicare programs (Assistance Listing Numbers 93.773,
93.774, and 93.770) as aggregate records corresponding to the amount
of money sent to a specific
 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-Contractors/What-is-a-MAC">Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)</a>
 in a given month. The recipients listed in these records are
"MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS," but the recipient location and primary place
of performance location fields in these records correspond to the
county where the MAC is located. As such, the location fields for
these records do not reflect the places where Medicare beneficiaries
or provider physicians/hospitals are located (which are usually in
different states than the MAC's location).

Note that, as per policy

the aggregate record format is intended to shield personally
identifiable information (PII) of individual citizens, rather than to
anonymize the names of companies like MACs.
