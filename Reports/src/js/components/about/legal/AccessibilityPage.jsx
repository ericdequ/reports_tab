            The U.S. Department of the Treasury is committed to making USASpending.gov accessible
            to all members of the public and ensuring that it meets or exceeds the
            requirements of&nbsp;

            To help users who are visually impaired users more easily distinguish content,
            we regularly test contrast and color schemes using a tool called&nbsp;

                Web Accessibility in Mind
            </a>. To ensure the site is accessible, we evaluate the site regularly using screen
            readers to check the accuracy and quality of the content and navigation. We use a
            variety of other techniques to ensure that all users can easily access the site;
            some of these include providing methods for skipping repetitive navigation and
            alternate text.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, we&#39;ve incorporated the following throughout the site:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text equivalents provided for non-text elements</li>
            <li>Colored information made available without color</li>
            <li>Documents can be read without a style sheet</li>
            <li>Text-only versions of data appear to comply with Section 508 standards,
                with the exception of maps
            </li>
            <li>Forms are formatted to work with assistive technology to access the information,
                field elements, and functionality required to complete and submit forms
            </li>
        </ul>

            &nbsp;if you have any difficulty accessing information on USASpending.gov.
